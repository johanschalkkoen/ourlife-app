Changes Made
useAccessibleUsers Hook:
Updated the /api/get-access call to include adminUsername:
jsx



axios.get(`${API_BASE}/get-access`, { params: { viewer: user.username, adminUsername: user.username } })
Added safety check for missing user.username:
jsx



if (!user?.username) {
  console.error('useAccessibleUsers: No username provided');
  setError('User not logged in');
  setTargetUsers([]);
  setUserProfiles({ [user?.username || 'unknown']: DEFAULT_PROFILE_PIC });
  return;
}
Enhanced error logging in the catch block:
jsx



console.error('useAccessibleUsers: Error fetching access list:', err.response?.data || err);
setError(err.response?.data?.message || 'Error fetching access list. Check server.');
Ensured userProfiles is set with the current user’s profile picture on error.
No Changes to Other Components:
Financial, Calendar, Login, Menu, ProfileSettings, Admin, and App remain identical to the previous version.
Styles, utility functions, and constants are unchanged.
The toggle button label and functionality (targetUsers, showTargetUsers) are unaffected, as they rely on useAccessibleUsers output.

Backup Current File:
bash




cp /root/ourlife-app/index.html /root/ourlife-app/index.html.bak-$(date +%F-%H%M%S)
Update index.html:
bash




nano /root/ourlife-app/index.html
Replace the entire content with the code above (from <!DOCTYPE html> to </html>).
Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).
Clear Cache and Restart Services:
bash




sudo systemctl restart nginx
pm2 restart ourlife-app-api-server
pm2 restart ourlife-app-web
sudo rm -rf /var/cache/nginx/*
Verify File Update:
Check the updated useAccessibleUsers API call:
bash




grep "get-access" /root/ourlife-app/index.html | grep adminUsername
Expected:
text



axios.get(`${API_BASE}/get-access`, { params: { viewer: user.username, adminUsername: user.username } })
Test as User schalk (based on logs):
Open https://ourlife.work.gd in an incognito window (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
Log in as schalk (use your known password, e.g., test1234).
Navigate to Financial:
Expected:
No “Admin username is required” error.
A toggle button labeled “Show/Hide Accessible Users’ Data” (since schalk has access to leani, johan, and test).
When teal (showTargetUsers=true), see financial items for schalk, leani, johan, and test for July 2025.
When gray (showTargetUsers=false), see only schalk’s items.
If an error persists, a red message (e.g., “Error fetching access list. Check server.”) appears above the button.
Open F12 > Console, look for:
text



useAccessibleUsers: Fetching access list for viewer: schalk
useAccessibleUsers: API response: {success: true, accessList: [{viewer: "schalk", target: "leani"}, {viewer: "schalk", target: "johan"}, {viewer: "schalk", target: "test"}]}
useAccessibleUsers: targetUsers set to: ["leani", "johan", "test"]
useAccessibleUsers: Profile pic for schalk: [URL or DEFAULT_PROFILE_PIC]
useAccessibleUsers: Profile pic for leani: [URL or DEFAULT_PROFILE_PIC]
useAccessibleUsers: Profile pic for johan: [URL or DEFAULT_PROFILE_PIC]
useAccessibleUsers: Profile pic for test: [URL or DEFAULT_PROFILE_PIC]
useAccessibleUsers: userProfiles set to: {schalk: "...", leani: "...", johan: "...", test: "..."}
Financial: fetchItems called, showTargetUsers: true, targetUsers: ["leani", "johan", "test"]
Financial: Fetching data for users: ["schalk", "leani", "johan", "test"]
Financial: Data fetched for schalk: [{id: 1, user: "schalk", description: "Salary", amount: 50000, type: "income", date: "2025-07-01 08:00:00"}, ...]
Financial: Combined items: [...]
F12 > Network:
/api/get-access?viewer=schalk&adminUsername=schalk: Should return {success: true, accessList: [{viewer: "schalk", target: "leani"}, {viewer: "schalk", target: "johan"}, {viewer: "schalk", target: "test"}]}
/api/financial?user=schalk, /api/financial?user=leani, etc., when button is teal.
Only /api/financial?user=schalk when gray.
Navigate to Calendar:
Expected: Same behavior for events, with the toggle button showing/hiding leani, johan, and test’s events.
Test as User test:
Log out, then log in as test (password: testpass1 or your set password).
Navigate to Financial:
Expected:
Toggle button labeled “Show/Hide Johan’s Data” (since test can view johan).
When teal, see test and johan’s financial items.
When gray, see only test’s items.
Console logs similar to above, with targetUsers: ["johan"].
Check pm2 Logs:
bash




pm2 logs ourlife-app-api-server
Expected:
No No adminUsername provided in req.body or req.query.
See:
text



Authenticated user: schalk
Access list fetched by schalk: [{viewer: "schalk", target: "leani"}, ...]
If the error persists, note the exact message and status code.
If the Error Persists:
Check the /api/get-access response in F12 > Network for status (e.g., 401, 400) and response body.
Share the exact error message and console logs.
Consider checking the back-end /api/get-access endpoint (likely in /root/ourlife-app/api-server.js or similar) to confirm it accepts viewer and adminUsername correctly. For example, it might expect:
javascript




app.get('/api/get-access', authenticate, (req, res) => {
  const { viewer, adminUsername } = req.query;
  if (!adminUsername) return res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: 'Admin username is required' });
  // ... rest of the logic
});
If the back-end requires a different parameter or authentication method (e.g., token-based), we may need to adjust the front-end call further.
Notes
The DEP0066 warning can be ignored for now, as it’s a Node.js deprecation and doesn’t affect functionality. To investigate, run node --trace-deprecation on the server and check the stack trace, but this is low priority.
If the back-end /api/get-access still rejects the request, we may need to inspect its code or test with a tool like Postman to confirm the expected parameters.
The access list log shows schalk has access to leani, johan, and test, and test has access to johan, which should work once the API call is fixed.





iSince you’ve confirmed the previous changes worked but the latest updates (Admin button styling and Budget Calculator) aren’t showing, let’s troubleshoot and ensure the new index.html is properly deployed. The changes were applied to the artifact with artifact_id="4b7c686b-698e-423e-9670-0a3dbbe841e2" and artifact_version_id="908cde99-4adc-4c15-8983-27e6de798727". Here’s how to resolve this:

Possible Issues and Fixes
File Not Updated:
The new index.html might not have been saved or copied to the correct location.
Action: Reapply the updated index.html content to /root/ourlife-app/index.html.
Server Cache:
Nginx or browser cache might be serving the old version.
Action: Clear Nginx cache and force a browser refresh.
Service Not Restarted:
Nginx or the Node.js app (ourlife-app-web) might not have restarted properly.
Action: Restart services and verify they’re running.
Incorrect Deployment Path:
The file might have been deployed to the wrong directory or server.
Action: Confirm the deployment path and server.
Browser Caching:
Your browser might be caching the old page.
Action: Test in an incognito window or clear browser cache.

Copy
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
Test at https://ourlife.work.gd/index-test.html.
Contact Server Admin (if not you):
If you’re not managing the server, share the index.html content and deployment instructions with the admin.
Ask them to confirm the file path and service status.
Next Steps
After performing these steps, please confirm if the "Budget Calculator" button appears in the menu and if the Admin buttons are styled (green for "Add User," yellow for "Update Password," blue for "Grant Access").
If still not visible, share:
Output of grep "BudgetCalculator" /root/ourlife-app/index.html.
Any errors from Nginx or PM2 logs.
Whether you’re testing in incognito mode and the browser used.
I can provide a diff of the changes or assist with further debugging.
If you want me to regenerate the index.html or focus on specific sections (e.g., just the Admin or BudgetCalculator components), let me know!
