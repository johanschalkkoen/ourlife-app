adding a Period Tracker component for female users and updating the ProfileSettings component to include a gender field, with the Period Tracker option only available to users who select "Female." The changes will align with the existing site’s style and follow the same deployment process as the Budget Calculator.

Requirements Breakdown
Period Tracker Component:
Create a new PeriodTracker component, accessible via a menu button next to "Budget Calculator" for female users only.
Allow female users to:
Log period start/end dates, cycle length, and symptoms (e.g., cramps, mood swings).
View a summary of their cycle history and predictions for upcoming periods.
Match the site’s style: Tailwind CSS, card design, Inter font, dark theme with teal accents, consistent with Financial and BudgetCalculator.
Include "Back to Menu" and "Sign Out" buttons, styled like other pages.
ProfileSettings Update:
Add a gender selection field (Male/Female) to the ProfileSettings component.
Save the gender to the user’s profile via the existing /api/profile-pictures endpoint (assumes backend supports a gender field).
Only show the "Period Tracker" menu option for users with gender: "Female".
Male users will not see the "Period Tracker" option.
Constraints:
Only modify ProfileSettings, Menu, and add PeriodTracker. No changes to other components (Login, Financial, Calendar, Admin, etc.).
Reuse the same artifact_id as before (4b7c686b-698e-423e-9670-0a3dbbe841e2) with a new version.
Ensure deployment instructions are provided, accounting for cache issues.
Implementation
Below is the updated index.html with the new PeriodTracker component and modifications to ProfileSettings and Menu. The code reuses existing utilities (Input, Button, ProfilePic, formatDateTime) and styles to ensure consistency.
