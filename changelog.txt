Key Features
Gender Saving:
The ProfileSettings component includes a gender field (Male/Female) that is saved to the /profile-pictures endpoint and stored in localStorage.
The App component fetches and updates the gender field on login and profile updates.
The Menu component conditionally displays the PeriodTracker option only for users with gender: 'Female'.
Period Tracker:
The PeriodTracker component allows users to log menstrual cycles (start date, end date, cycle length, symptoms) and saves them to the /period-tracker endpoint.
Cycle data is fetched and displayed with predictions for the next period and fertile days.
A POST request is sent to the n8n webhook URL when a new cycle is added, triggering a WhatsApp notification with the user’s phone number.
WhatsApp Trigger:
The handleAddCycle function in PeriodTracker sends a POST request to the n8n webhook URL with cycle details and the user’s phone number (from ProfileSettings).
Backend Requirements:
The backend must support /period-tracker (GET/POST) for cycle data and /profile-pictures (GET/POST) for profile data, including gender.
The n8n webhook URL must be configured to handle WhatsApp notifications.
